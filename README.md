Hey there! 👋 I'm a tech enthusiast with a passion for simplifying complex problems, especially in the realms of AI and robotics. My academic journey at UC San Diego was packed with learning and hands-on projects in Intelligent Systems and Robotics, sprinkled with a healthy dose of real-world experience through some pretty cool internships.

At SpaceX, I had the chance to work on solenoid valves, pushing production limits and quality through the roof 🚀. Then, at Amazon Robotics, I got to double down on robot test capacities, turning testing scenarios into a sort of art form 🤖. My adventure continued at RoboCoach Inc., where I led an exciting project that turned everyday English into code, hopefully making life a bit easier for my fellow coders 💻.

University wasn't just about lectures and exams for me. I dove into projects ranging from crafting gadgets to help the elderly stay active 🏋️‍♂️, to navigating robots through uncharted territories without a scratch 🗺️. I even managed to crunch down a task from 58 minutes to a mere 2 seconds—yes, I love making things run faster and smoother ⏩!

In the Existential Robotics Lab, I got my hands dirty with drones and autonomous cars, ensuring they behaved and followed the paths laid out for them 🚗.

Mixing a dash of playfulness with my technical skills, I see myself not just as an engineer but as a creative problem solver, always on the lookout for the next big challenge in tech. And yes, I tackle these challenges with a big smile on my face 😊!
